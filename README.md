## :dart: About

This application was developed based on a prototype provided during the Ignite course. The initial proposal was to develop from scratch a Next application using Chakra and Swiper, just delivering the home page, the European continent page, header and the format for 375px screens.

However, after making small customizations to the layout, I increased the project including footer with navigable menu and pages from all continents, looking for real information to feed all 6 routes, in addition to providing such information through a file that provides all the information for the application.

The data is provided by files to 'simulate' an external call, as the application in its current state supports such a method. However, to simplify the deployment, it was done in this way. The images are generated through the Unsplash API and the flags through the CDN Flag.

The application has easily reusable components, as most of them have static data dynamically distributed through prop drilling and context.

Currently the application has dark mode, and can be accessed without layout breaks by the most used devices on the market.

New features may be added in the future.
