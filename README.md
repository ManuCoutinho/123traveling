## :dart: About

This project is based on the 100 most visited cities in the world. The six routes compile images and information from the most visited continents and cities, based on research made available in recent years.

The data is compiled and distributed by files to 'simulate' an external call, as the application in its current state supports such a method. In the future, they will be received through their own API.
Images are received via the Unsplash API, which contains all tracking data (UTM links, download, author, etc...) and flags via the CDN Flag.

The application has easily reusable components, as most of them have data dynamically distributed through contexts and SSR call.

Currently the application has dark mode, and can be accessed without layout breaks by the most used devices on the market.

New features may be added in the future!
